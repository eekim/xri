=== XRI Parsing ===

* Fully Qualified or not?
** xri://

* s{^xri:(//)?}{};  # Strip xri://
* Look for a GCS [=, @, !, +, $] in first char
** "#{gcs}foo" is same as: gcs + "*foo"
* If first char is !, 2nd must be ! too.
* split segments into a list.  Keep the deliminator (* or !) w/ the segement.
** Eg.g:  =foo*bar!qux becomes [*foo, *bar, !qux]
** Do not save parens, but also ensure they are balanced.
