XRI

XRI 2.0 resolver library, including an XRDS parser (a subset of which
is used for Yadis).  May be used for resolving i-names and beyond.

This is basically a port of Victor Grey and Kermit Snelson's ruby barx
code, including a Perl-ish implementation of their API.  Much love and
credit go to Fen Labalme, whose original XRI Perl library was the very
first implementation of the XRI specification.
