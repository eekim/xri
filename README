XRI

XRI is a library for resolving eXtensible Resource Identifiers (XRI),
which is a metalanguage for describing identifiers.  (XRIs are to
URIs, as XML is to HTML.)  XRIs serve as the basis for i-names, which
can be used as identifiers for OpenID 2.0.

This library includes support for parsing XRI Resource Descriptors and
Yadis, which is OpenID's discovery format.  This library is mostly
compliant with the OASIS XRI 2.0 specification.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Much love and credit go to Fen Labalme, whose original XRI Perl
library was the very first implementation of the XRI specification,
and who has been passionately committed to building user-centric
identity systems for over two decades.

Thanks also to Victor Grey and Kermit Snelson, whose Ruby XRI resolver
(barx) helped us navigate the complexities of the spec and provided
some of our test cases.  Many thanks to Drummond Reed and Gabe Wachob,
the co-chairs of the XRI Technical Committee, as well as John Bradley
and Andy Dale for patiently answering our many questions about the
spec.

Finally, thanks to Scott Kveton, Chris Messina, and David Recordon for
organizing OpenIDDevCamp, which provided the critical resources
(i.e. food, beer, and wireless) necessary to finish this library.
